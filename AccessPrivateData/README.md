Accessing Private Data <br/>
All data on a smart contract can be read including private data.<br/>
1)migrate the contract to Ropsten network<br/>
2)start a truffle console that is connected to the ropsten test network<br/>
3)get the contract and its address:<br/>
4)execute the addSomeUser() function<br/>
5)get the state variable that is stored in slot 0 , because the first declared variable is dynamic array so the length of array is stored in slot 0<br/>
6)array elements is stored in slots starting from hash(0)<br/>
The returning value is actually username of first User that has been pushed to array<br/>

7)converting bytes32 username to alphabet<br/>
8) in the next slot , the password of first user has been stored : (add slot hash by 1 to access next slot)<br/>
In the next slot , username of second user has been stored and so on â€¦ 9)the mapping has been declared in slot 1 , so for accessing data we should <br/>
calculate the hash of mapping index with this slot<br/>
10)uint value(block.timestamp) that has mapped to index 1 (the second user that has been pushed to structure )<br/>
